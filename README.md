# Morse Keyer

As a licensed amateur radio hobbyist, I wanted to learn morse code by doing.
However, there are no tools that I know of that translate keypress durations to morse and alphanumericals.
So, I designed a morse keyer in Fusion 360, 3D-printed it using a Creality Ender 3 V2, and programmed it using Arduino C++ and Python.
