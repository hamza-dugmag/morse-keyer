# Morse Keyer

Since I am interested in amateur radio, I have always wanted to learn morse code by doing. However,
there are no websites which I know of that translate keypress durations to morse and alphanumericals.
And anyway, I do not want to be restricted to typing morse on a website.

So, I designed a custom HID morse keyer in Fusion 360, 3D-printed it using a Creality Ender 3 V2, and
programmed it using Arduino C++ and Python.
